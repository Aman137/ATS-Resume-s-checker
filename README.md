# ATS-Resume-s-checker
ATS-resume-Checker This Streamlit app allows users to upload a resume in PDF format. The app uses the pdf2image library to convert the PDF into images and the google-generativeai library to extract text from these images. The extracted text is then analyzed to generate an ATS-friendly summary for the resume.
